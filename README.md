# Dog-Age
Codecademy project! converting human age to Dog years, using JS
First of all, I commented each step in the code for understanding!!

At start, you will find a var assigned to human age, this var could be changed to any human age which will convert it to dog years!!

The first two years of a dogâ€™s life count as 10.5 dog years each, since we already accounted for the first two years, we subtracted two from the original human years,
to a later years of dog years.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

The var myAgeInDogYears, coverted human age to dog years. The human name assigned in lower-case

Lastly, the final statement that displays your name and age in dog years!!!
